1. To create 100 users with an average of 10 friends each, how many times would you need to call `addFriendship()`? Why?
1A.) The function would be called 100 times since each persons friends list is only called once with an average of 10 iterations
so maybe 1000 instead
2. If you create 1000 users with an average of 5 random friends each, what percentage of other users
 will be in a particular user's extended social network? What is the average degree of separation between 
 a user and those in his/her extended network?
 
 2A.) It would be as close to 5% as possible since 1000 is a pretty big test group and the average extended network 
 (degree of separation) would be about 6
